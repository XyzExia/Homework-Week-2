# Homework-Week-2

- added various things, mostly just messing with the flex box and having them adjsut with the screen sizes.
- most of the text is dummy text.
- added the hover function on the head nav bar 
- added the transform on the place holders for the projects.

I didnt really focus on style so it kinda looks a bit ulgy tbh since the main focus was trying to get the flex boxes to work as intented. That and trying to get animations/ and styling to fit well.
